# Jupyter notebook description

Here we list the various Jupyter notebooks we have written to illustrate how to use tcapy, in particular for understanding
how to call the library programatically 

Sometimes GitHub might not render the Jupyter notebooks, in which case you can use the nbviewer link

* [Introducing tcapy and explaining TCA](introducing_tcapy.ipynb) - how to use tcapy in more detail 
and gives many examples of how to call it programmatically 
([nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/cuemacro/tcapy/blob/master/tcapy_notebooks/introducing_tcapy.ipynb))
* [Compliance and other more involved TCA calculations](compliance_tca_calculations) - how to do 
TCA calculations for compliance and other more involved use cases
([nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/cuemacro/tcapy/blob/master/tcapy_notebooks/compliance_tca_calculations))
* [Populating databases for tcapy](populating_databases_for_tcapy.ipynb) - how to 
populate your trade/order (MySQL/SQLite/Microsoft SQL Server) and market data databases (Arctic/MongoDB/PyStore)
([nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/cuemacro/tcapy/blob/master/tcapy_notebooks/populating_databases_for_tcapy.ipynb))
* [Excel/xlwings with tcapy](excel_xlwings_with_tcapy.ipynb) - how to run tcapy from Excel
with xlwings, with a demo spreadsheet
([nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/cuemacro/tcapy/blob/master/tcapy_notebooks/excel_xlwings_with_tcapy.ipynb))
* [Additional benchmark and metrics for tcapy](additional_benchmarks_metrics_for_tcapy.ipynb) - we go through some of the
benchmarks and metrics available in tcapy in more detail
([nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/cuemacro/tcapy/blob/master/tcapy_notebooks/additional_benchmarks_metrics_for_tcapy.ipynb))
